## Hack CMU's Website
=======================================

**Created By**: Richard Huang

I was consulted to create the website for the HackCMU hackathon, Fall 2015. This was created using Bootstrap and a lot of different custom CSS. Both the master and gh-pages branch contains a template for HackCMU and future uses. The heroku branch is the one that is currently deployed (which is currenlty in post-hackathon mode).

gh-pages branch deployement: http://rahuang.github.io/HackCMUWebsite/

heroku branch and official website: http://hackcmu.com/
